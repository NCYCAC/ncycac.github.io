The North Carolina Youth Classical Arts for Charity (NCYCAC) is a team of service-minded youth from North Carolina, and we strive to enrich, enlighten and empower youth leaders, provide performance opportunities for youth artists, and enable youth to impact the community through charitable service. Our passion for Carnatic (South Indian Classical) music has led us to provide North American youth Carnatic musicians a venue in which to showcase their talents, in an effort to inspire the future generations to maintain and build upon this centuries old tradition. Each year, we host a Youth Music Fundraiser Festival in the Research Triangle Park area, in which we highlight advanced youth Carnatic music talents from North Carolina and other parts of the United States. We use this gathering of like-minded and motivated youth artists and leaders as an opportunity to raise money for a charity of our choice. Since 2010, we have supported Sankara Nethralaya, Akshaya Trust, AIM for Seva, Vibha, the Swami Vivekananda Youth Movement, and Meals on Wheels, and for these charities, we have raised over $80,000.
