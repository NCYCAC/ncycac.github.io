NCYCAC Annual Youth Music Festival is the largest of its kind run by the youth in the United States. Inaugurated in 2010, the NCYCAC Festival is organized every year during the Labor Day weekend. Youth carnatic artists from across the United States enthusiastically converge in North Carolina's Research Triangle Park area and participate in the Festival. Thus, the Festival enables students from various stages of their musical journey to conference, showcase their talent, have fun, and be inspired to grow further in their pursuit to become musicians.
